# Twitter-Clone
This is an Android App which is clone of twitter and has a basic functionality of the viewing users feed, following users and posted tweets.

This app is developed by Siddharth Singh.

For data storage and fetching, the app is supported by the server Parse provided by Bitnami and is powered by Amazon AWS EC2 instance. The app allows users to signUp/LogIn and then provides an interface to follow/Unfollow other users. The user can view the tweets from his following users and can post a tweet which his follwers can view. In the menu items, the user can View his feed, tweet and logout. One major feature which this release is missing is the like and share option.

*NOTE:* This app is solely the work of Siddharth Singh and have used few open source library and resources.

Enjoy programming!! :)
